# 🌟 TalentHub.Show – AI-Powered Talent Discovery Platform 🚀

**TalentHub.Show** is a next-generation hiring platform reimagining how companies **discover and evaluate talent**. We leverage AI to turn raw video interviews into **rich, interactive profiles** that show — not tell — what candidates can do.

Our mission is to help companies **hire smarter and faster** while empowering job seekers to **present their true selves** with zero writing involved.

## 🎯 About the Platform

At TalentHub.Show, candidates **speak once**, and AI does the rest.

From a single video conversation, our system generates

* ✅ A **non-traditional résumé** crafted entirely from the candidate’s spoken words
* ✅ A **knowledge graph** of values, experiences, and skills
* ✅ **Semantic tags** that jump straight to the relevant video moment

🧠 **There’s no written content by users.** Every word is captured, processed, and transformed by AI.
