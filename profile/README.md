Here’s an updated version of the **TalentHub.Show README** with added `Who We Need` and `Internship` sections in the same spirit as JobSearch.Works:

# 🌟 TalentHub.Show – AI-Powered Talent Discovery Platform 🚀

**TalentHub.Show** is a next-generation hiring platform reimagining how companies **discover and evaluate talent**. We leverage AI to turn raw video interviews into **rich, interactive profiles** that show—not tell—what candidates can do.

Our mission is to help companies **hire smarter and faster** while empowering job seekers to **present their true selves** with zero writing involved.

---

## 🎯 About the Platform

At TalentHub.Show, candidates **speak once**, and AI does the rest.

From a single video conversation, our system generates:
✅ A **non-traditional resume** entirely from the candidate’s spoken words
✅ A **knowledge graph** of values, experiences, and skills
✅ **Semantic tags** that link directly to relevant video segments

🧠 **There’s no written content by users.** Every word is captured, processed, and transformed by AI.

---

## 🎥 Key Features

### For Recruiters & Employers:

* 🔍 **Search candidates** by soft skills, values, and experience
* ▶️ **Click-to-watch** specific segments using smart video tagging
* 📄 **Read AI-written summaries** built from actual spoken context
* 🤝 **Understand mindset and culture fit**—not just keywords

### For Talent:

* 🎙️ **Just speak**—no need to write resumes or bios
* 🌟 **Be discovered** by employers using smart search
* 🔗 Share your **video-based professional identity** with a single link

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Structured Interview Recording**
   We capture a guided video session with each candidate
2. **AI-Driven Processing**
   Transcripts, knowledge extraction, and tag generation happen automatically
3. **Dynamic Profile Generation**
   The result is a profile with:

   * Interactive video timeline
   * Clickable skill and value tags
   * AI-generated resume and bio
   * A structured knowledge graph

✅ See the *real person*, not a polished CV
✅ Reduce **screening time** with deep insights up front
✅ Open doors to **diverse candidates** who shine through voice, not bullet points
✅ Make hiring **human again**, powered by AI
